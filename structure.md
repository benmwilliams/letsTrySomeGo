## To convention or not to convention...

The creators of golang envisioned a directory structure like
"/$HOME/go/< src | bin | pkg >/github.com/< me | someone-else | another-guy >"
I just don't know if I like typing in all that extra stuff if I'm using a lot
of other gocode that I wrote. What I prefer is like
"/$HOME/go/repo/thing-im-doing"... I know it doesn't really matter.

#### TODO: decide if I want to follow convention with this or not
